# Bank-Database-Project
Hi! This is a project that involves the construction of a simple database using MySQL modeled after the structure of a bank.

The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with the fundamentals of database development and management, incorporating tables, constraints, functions, and procedures. Before building the database, I designed an entity relationship (ER) diagram first to organize the development process.

Primary keys are colored orange and relationships are colored blue. This is a simplified model, as banks have additional complexity to company structure and data.

Overall however, this was a very enlightening project to work on!
